These folders contain various excercises and projects based on themes and learning activites found.

Setups for each resource is as follows:

*Beejs Guide to C Programming: Every Chapter is divided into examples and a project. In examples one can find code snippets from the book together with my own comments and thoughts, this is mostly for my own learning. The project is usually something simple(Im not that creative) that tries to showcase the methods learnt in the chapter. If relevant I will try to use the AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano as much as possible during these projects to better myself in terms of Hardware :D
